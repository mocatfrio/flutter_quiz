# Final Project: Mobile Programming with Flutter

This final project aims to apply the concepts and skills acquired during the Mobile Programming with Flutter course. Students will develop a mobile application using Flutter, showcasing their ability to implement a functional app.

## Project Objectives

* Able to **implement various Widgets** to create mobile application interfaces 
* Able to **implement state management**
* Able to **handle data input with forms** and create **form validation**
* Able to **connect mobile applications to the backend** and store data in the database

## Assessment Criteria

| Application | Originality | Demo | 
| ----------- | ----------- | ---- | 
| 80%         | 10%         | 10%  | 

**Application (80%):**

| Widgets | State Management | Handle Data & Form Validation | Backend |
| ------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- | ------- |
| 10%     | 25%              | 25%                           | 40%     |

**Widgets (10%):**

| Criteria       | Desc                        | 
| -------------- | --------------------------- | 
| Widget Variety | Use various Widget | 

**State Management (25%):**

| Criteria             | Desc                                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| State Implementation | Use `StatefulWidget` and `State classes` to manage and update `state variables`                  |
| State Modification   | Implement `setState` method to update `state variables` in response to user actions              |
| UI Interaction       | Demonstrate `UI components` that dynamically update based on state changes managed by `setState` |

**Handle Data & Form Validation (25%):**

| Criteria         | Desc                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Input Handling   | Use various widgets form like `TextField` or `TextFormField` to capture user input |
| Form Validation  | Implement validators to validate user input against specific criteria              |
| Feedback to User | Provide clear feedback messages, such as error and success notification            |

**Backend (40%):**

| Criteria         | Desc                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create*   | Add new records by filling out a form and sending data to the backend via a `POST` request |
| Read*  | Fetch existing records from the backend via `GET` requests             |
| Update* | Enable users to edit record and send updates to the backend via `PUT` or `PATCH` requests            |
| Delete* | Allow users to delete records and send `DELETE` requests to the backend            |

*) For each criterion, **handling loading states and errors, as well as updating the UI**, is required, but it is evaluated under the **State Management** criteria.
